# Orbit

Orbit is a performance-first UI suite that builds directly into Blizzard's native Edit Mode. No complex setup, no heavy overhaul—just high-end extensions for the default UI.

## The Essentials

- **Edit Mode Native**
- **Cooldown Manager**
- **Enhanced Unit Frames**
- **Advanced Class Resources**
- **Cast Bars**
- **Resource Bars**
- **Action Bars**
- **Pixel-Perfect Precision**
- **Smart Profiles**

## Why use it?

- **Clean Modern UI Design**
- **Zero Bloat:** Event-driven architecture ensures it won't tank your FPS.
- **Combat Safe:** Taint-free engineering to avoid "Action Blocked" errors.
- **Semi Customizable:** The aim is to have customization without thousands of options.

## More to Come

This Addon is still in alpha testing, it's not feature complete yet and I'm still polishing for a version 1.0 release.
